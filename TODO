1. add global class for system validity check. (Finite State Machine)
	1.1. Just implement remaining states.
	1.2 Based on response from ServerMessageHandler, update state.
2. receive message from server, deserialize it and get a KVMessage.
	2.1 Create a Payload based on msgBytes
3. based on KVMessage, perform appropriate actions by client.
	3.1 Handle cases in ServerMEssageHandler
4. Handle Client Commands like help, loglevel and quit
5. implement logging.
6. handle unhandled exceptions.
7. Think of a better Payload (something like HTTP) and a better serialization Message.
	7.1 This should work fine as of now.
8. Store a metadata file for the client, which will have server IP and ranges. Update the file if 
   it contacted wrong node, and retry the request with correct node.
	8.1 Covered in Case handling of ServerMessageHandler.

CURRENT:
1. update

ISSUES:
1. for how much time does the input stream bytes remain intact. What if the read from KVStore
is called after another round of while(isRunning) is invoked, will the payload become null, or remain there.
